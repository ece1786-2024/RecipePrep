        "original_instructions": "1. Heat oven to 375 degrees F.\n2. Wash the turkey, inside and out, and dry well. Coat inside and outside with olive oil. Season turkey on the outside with salt and pepper, pressing it in to adhere. Place 2 rosemary sprigs, 1 thyme sprig, 1 sage sprig, 1 oregano sprig and lemon halves inside the cavity of the turkey. Place cooling rack or roasting rack in bottom of large roasting pan. Place turkey on rack, and arrange carrots, celery and remaining herbs on bottom of pan around turkey. Pour 4 cups (1 carton) chicken broth and water over vegetables and herbs.\n3. Roast until an instant-read thermometer (inserted deep into the thigh but away from the bone) reads 165 degrees F and juices in the thigh run clear when pierced with a fork, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, basting with pan broth every 30 minutes. Remove turkey from the pan and let rest for 15 minutes before carving. Strain and reserve pan juices, and discard vegetables.\n4. While turkey is resting, make the gravy. In a medium heavy saucepan, cook flour and butter over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until a blond roux is formed. Add pan juices and 4 cups (1 carton) of chicken broth; heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce the heat and let simmer until thickened and ready to serve.\n5. Carve turkey as desired, and serve with gravy.\nCopyright 2010 Michael Chiarello\nRecipe provided by Chef Michael Chiarello - June 2010.",

        "original_instructions": "Combine the garlic, ginger, chiles and 3 tablespoons kosher salt in a food processor and process to a fine paste; transfer the marinade to a large bowl. Using a paring knife, pierce each chicken wing two or three times through the skin then add to the marinade, tossing to coat evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight.\nMeanwhile, toast the coconut in a medium skillet over medium heat, stirring often until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the coconut to a bowl and let cool.\nMake the raita: Combine the cucumber and 1 teaspoon salt in colander set over a bowl, toss to combine and let stand for 30 minutes. Use your hands to squeeze as much moisture as possible from the cucumbers, then transfer them to a bowl. Stir in the yogurt, cilantro, lime zest and juice. Season the raita with more salt and pepper then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 2 days. Stir before serving.\nPut the chickpea flour in a large bowl. Using tongs, remove half the wings from the marinade and toss with the flour to coat evenly. Transfer the wings to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and repeat the dredging process with the remaining wings. Discard any leftover chickpea flour.\nHeat 2 inches of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Working in 2 batches, fry the wings, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, 16 to 18 minutes per batch. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the wings to a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. (Make sure the oil returns to the proper temperature between batches.)\nToast the mustard and coriander seeds in a medium skillet over medium heat, swirling the pan until the mustard seeds begin to pop and the spices are fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the turmeric, cook for 10 seconds, then stir in the butter. Heat until the butter melts and the spices begin to sizzle, about 1 minute. Pour the butter and spices over the chicken wings, toss to coat, then transfer to a serving platter. Add the toasted coconut to the seasonings left in the large bowl, then sprinkle over the wings. Serve immediately with the raita on the side.",
