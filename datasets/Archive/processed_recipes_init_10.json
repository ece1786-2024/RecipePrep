Adjust heat so water stays at gentle but steady ripple and cook uncovered until all water is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Do not stir.\nFluff rice gently with fork and cool 1 hour. Do not cover.\nFluff rice gently again, then spoon lightly, do not pack, into plastic storage containers, snap on lids, label, and date.
