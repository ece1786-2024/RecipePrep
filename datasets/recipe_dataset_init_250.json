Cook garlic, stirring occasionally, until sizzling, about 3 minutes. Season very generously with black pepper and cook, smashing with a wooden spoon, until cloves break into rough pieces, soften, and look golden. Add kale to pot and cook, stirring often, until darkened in color and very tender, about 8 minutes (garlic will break into even smaller pieces). Season with kosher salt and pepper.\nMeanwhile, cook pasta, stirring occasionally, until very al dente (2\u20133 minutes less than package directions).\nUsing tongs, add pasta to kale; splash in about 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Cook, tossing and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce lightly coats pasta, about 2 minutes.\nServe pasta topped with Parmesan, red pepper flakes, sea salt, and more black pepper.",

Add the water and olive oil and mix to make a shaggy, sticky dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead into a smooth and elastic ball, 2 to 3 minutes. Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a flat disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and let rest in a warm place, 15 minutes.\nBrush two large sheets of parchment paper with olive oil. Place a ball of dough between the parchment, oiled-sides in; use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 12- to 14-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Remove the top piece of parchment and transfer the dough (and the bottom piece of parchment) to a pizza peel or inverted baking sheet.\nSpread 1/3 cup sauce on the crust; scatter with 3/4 cup mozzarella. Slide the pizza (on the parchment) onto the hot stone. Bake until the crust is crisp and golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool 1 to 2 minutes before slicing. Repeat to make the second pizza.\nPhotograph by Levi Brown",

Once most of the flour has combined, turn the dough out to a smooth, clean work surface dusted with flour and use your hands to knead the dough to a smooth consistency.\nLightly coat the mixing bowl with oil, return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, at least 1 hour.\nFor the pizza topping: Coat a large saute pan with oil, add the sausage and bring to medium heat. Cook the sausage until brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and reserve.\nWhile the sausage cooks, mix together in a medium bowl the ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano and oregano.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F and preheat a grill.\nWhen the dough is ready, portion it into six golf-ball-size pieces. (If you're not using the dough right away, wrap each ball individually in plastic and refrigerate until ready to use.) Dust a work surface with flour and roll each piece of dough into a rectangle (or whatever shape you like; I like irregular shapes).\nBrush the grill with oil and arrange each piece of dough on the grill; you might need to work in batches here. Grill until the dough is stiff and crisp and has lovely grill marks on it, then flip and repeat on the second side, moving occasionally so the bottom doesn't burn.\nPut the pizzas on baking sheets, smear each with some of the ricotta mixture, top with sausage and put as many pizzas as will comfortably fit in the oven; bake until the cheese has melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Again, you may have to work in batches. Remove the pizzas from the oven, top with arugula and drizzle with the deliciously spicy chili oil!",
