    "recipe_title": "Extra-Crispy Indian Spiced Chicken Wings",
    "original_instructions": "Combine the garlic, ginger, chiles and 3 tablespoons kosher salt in a food processor and process to a fine paste; transfer the marinade to a large bowl. Using a paring knife, pierce each chicken wing two or three times through the skin then add to the marinade, tossing to coat evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight.\nMeanwhile, toast the coconut in a medium skillet over medium heat, stirring often until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the coconut to a bowl and let cool.\nMake the raita: Combine the cucumber and 1 teaspoon salt in colander set over a bowl, toss to combine and let stand for 30 minutes. Use your hands to squeeze as much moisture as possible from the cucumbers, then transfer them to a bowl. Stir in the yogurt, cilantro, lime zest and juice. Season the raita with more salt and pepper then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 2 days. Stir before serving.\nPut the chickpea flour in a large bowl. Using tongs, remove half the wings from the marinade and toss with the flour to coat evenly. Transfer the wings to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and repeat the dredging process with the remaining wings. Discard any leftover chickpea flour.\nHeat 2 inches of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Working in 2 batches, fry the wings, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, 16 to 18 minutes per batch. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the wings to a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. (Make sure the oil returns to the proper temperature between batches.)\nToast the mustard and coriander seeds in a medium skillet over medium heat, swirling the pan until the mustard seeds begin to pop and the spices are fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the turmeric, cook for 10 seconds, then stir in the butter. Heat until the butter melts and the spices begin to sizzle, about 1 minute.

    "recipe_title": "Simple Roast Chicken with Gravy",
    "original_instructions": "Special equipment: A small roasting pan and rack, butcher's twine\nPat the chicken dry inside and out with paper towels, and let sit at room temperature to take the chill off, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 450 degrees F. Put a rack in a small roasting pan.\nSeason the cavity of the chicken generously with salt and pepper, and stuff it with the thyme and garlic. Tie the legs together with butcher's twine. Season the outside with salt (generously) and a few grinds of pepper, and place the chicken breast-side up on the rack. (Seasoning the chicken when on the rack could result in gravy that's too salty.)\nRoast the chicken until the skin is golden brown and crispy and a thermometer inserted in the deepest part of the thigh registers 165 to 170 degrees F, depending on how you like your dark meat, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let the chicken rest on the rack for a few minutes, then carefully tip it forward to drain all the collected juices into the roasting pan. Discard the thyme and garlic. Let the chicken rest on a cutting board while you make the gravy. (To transfer the chicken easily, hold a wooden spoon handle in the cavity with one hand and use the other hand to lift the chicken with tongs.)\nRemove the rack from the pan, and pour the pan drippings into a small bowl. Skim off 2 tablespoons of the fat, and stir them into the flour and 2 tablespoons water in another small bowl. Heat the roasting pan over medium-high heat, add the wine, scrape up any browned bits and simmer until the wine reduces by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken stock and any remaining pan drippings, bring to a simmer, add the flour mixture and whisk constantly until the liquid thickens into a gravy, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the gravy with salt and pepper.\nRemove the butcher's twine from the chicken. Snip off the wingtips using kitchen shears; reserve to make stock. Remove the leg quarters by slicing between the thigh and the body, then finding the hip joints near the backbone and slicing through them. Separate the drumsticks and thighs, and transfer to a platter. Sit the carcass upright; snip out the backbone and reserve it to make stock. Lay the breast skin-side up and slice in half through the breastbone. Separate the wings and breast, and transfer to the platter. Serve the chicken with the warm gravy. Reserve the carcass to make stock.",
