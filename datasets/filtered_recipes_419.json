Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the wine and raise the heat level to high, bring to a boil and cook until the liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Tie the rosemary and thyme together with kitchen twine and add the bundle to the pot.\nPlace the roasted ribs on top of the vegetables in the pot and add the beef stock. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Cover the pot and simmer until the meat is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours.\nCarefully remove the short ribs from the pot and set aside. Discard the herbs and skim the excess fat. Continue to cook the vegetables and sauce over medium heat for 20 minutes until reduced to the desired consistency. Put the ribs back in the pot and heat through.\nFor the polenta: Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and very slowly whisk in the cornmeal polenta, whisking constantly to make sure there are no lumps. Switch to a wooden spoon and add the salt and pepper and simmer, stirring almost constantly, until the polenta thickens, about 30 minutes. When the polenta is thick and difficult to stir, quickly turn off the heat, add the grated cheeses and fold together. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan thoroughly while combining.\nFor the mission fig glaze: Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepot over low heat and saute the shallots until just translucent, a few minutes. Add the vinegar and herbs and increase the heat to medium high. Reduce by half, stirring constantly. Add the figs, sugar and wine and further reduce by a third, continuing to stir throughout. Remove from the heat when you have about 3/4 cup liquid remaining. Pour the glaze through a fine mesh strainer into a small bowl, discarding the solids.\nHeat the olive oil in a large heavy pot or skillet over medium high heat.\nThoroughly wash the kale and remove the stems. Tear the leaves into large bite-size pieces and dry them, either in a salad spinner or on paper towels.\nDrop 5 to 7 pieces of kale in the hot oil and fry until crisp, 60 to 90 seconds. Drain on a wire rack set over paper towels and season with kosher salt while hot. Repeat with the remaining kale until all the pieces are crisp.\nTo serve, spoon some polenta on each serving plate. Place a hot short rib from the cooking liquid on the polenta and spoon over some of the reduced liquid. Drizzle with the fig glaze. Top with some crispy kale.",

    "original_instructions": "1. Soak the mushrooms in 1 cup hot water for 20 minutes. 2. Heat a heavy-based, high-sided frying pan or saucepan over medium heat. Add a generous chunk of butter and a glug of oil and saut\u00e9 the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes until soft but not colored. 3. Add the rice and stir vigorously around the pan for a couple of minutes until the grains start to turn slightly translucent at the edges. Deglaze the pan by pouring in the wine and scraping up the bits at the bottom. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for a minute or two to burn off the alcohol. 4. Meanwhile, heat the stock and add the soaking liquor from the mushrooms. Add a ladleful of the hot stock mixture to the rice and stir over medium heat until absorbed, then add another ladleful. Repeat until all the stock is used up or the rice is tender but still al dente. Make sure to stir regularly to create a creamy risotto. (This should take about 20 minutes.) 5. Chop the rehydrated mushrooms into small pieces and gently stir into the cooked risotto. Add a chunk of butter and the Parmesan, then stir to mix well. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary, then leave the risotto to cool (it will do this more quickly if you spread it onto a baking sheet). 6. If using mini mozzarella balls, halve them; if using part of a large ball, cut it into 3/4-inch cubes. 7. Lay out 3 plates or shallow bowls. Put the beaten eggs in one, the flour (seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper) in another, and the breadcrumbs in the final one. 8. Once the risotto is cooled (it doesn't matter if it is still a little warm, as long as it has stiffened up a bit and is cool enough to handle), roll it into balls the size of golf balls. Push a piece of mozzarella into the middle of each ball, making sure that the cheese is completely enclosed. Leave to set in the fridge for at least 30 minutes or overnight. 9. Heat a deep-fat fryer to 340\u00b0F or fill a large saucepan one-third full of flavorless oil and heat until a cube of bread dropped into the hot oil sizzles and turns golden brown in 30 seconds. 10. Dip a rice ball into the flour, shake off any excess, then dip into the egg, allowing any excess to drip off. Finish by coating completely in the breadcrumbs. Repeat with the remaining balls. 11. Deep-fry the balls in batches for 2-3 minutes until golden brown all over. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Serve immediately while the middles are still melting. Drizzle with lemon juice, if using.\n1. Soak the mushrooms in 1 cup hot water for 20 minutes.\n2. Heat a heavy-based, high-sided frying pan or saucepan over medium heat. Add a generous chunk of butter and a glug of oil and saut\u00e9 the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes until soft but not colored.\n3. Add the rice and stir vigorously around the pan for a couple of minutes until the grains start to turn slightly translucent at the edges. Deglaze the pan by pouring in the wine and scraping up the bits at the bottom. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for a minute or two to burn off the alcohol.\n4. Meanwhile, heat the stock and add the soaking liquor from the mushrooms. Add a ladleful of the hot stock mixture to the rice and stir over medium heat until absorbed, then add another ladleful. Repeat until all the stock is used up or the rice is tender but still al dente. Make sure to stir regularly to create a creamy risotto. (This should take about 20 minutes.)\n5. Chop the rehydrated mushrooms into small pieces and gently stir into the cooked risotto. Add a chunk of butter and the Parmesan, then stir to mix well. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary, then leave the risotto to cool (it will do this more quickly if you spread it onto a baking sheet).\n6. If using mini mozzarella balls, halve them; if using part of a large ball, cut it into 3/4-inch cubes.\n7. Lay out 3 plates or shallow bowls. Put the beaten eggs in one, the flour (seasoned with a pinch of salt and pepper) in another, and the breadcrumbs in the final one.\n8.

    "original_instructions": "For the chili oil: Bring the chilies and oil to a simmer in a small saucepan; remove from the heat and let the peppers steep in the oil for at least an hour or until the dough has risen and you're ready to make the pizzas. This can be done way in advance.\nFor the dough: In a small bowl, add 1/2 cup warm water (if the water is too hot the yeast will die and if the water is too cold the yeast will not activate). Add the dry yeast and sugar, stir to combine and let sit for 15 minutes. The top of the water will bubble and it will smell very yeasty; this is what you want.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the olive oil and the yeast/water mixture. Using a fork, gradually stir the flour into the yeast/water mix. Once most of the flour has combined, turn the dough out to a smooth, clean work surface dusted with flour and use your hands to knead the dough to a smooth consistency.\nLightly coat the mixing bowl with oil, return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, at least 1 hour.\nFor the pizza topping: Coat a large saute pan with oil, add the sausage and bring to medium heat. Cook the sausage until brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and reserve.\nWhile the sausage cooks, mix together in a medium bowl the ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano and oregano.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F and preheat a grill.\nWhen the dough is ready, portion it into six golf-ball-size pieces. (If you're not using the dough right away, wrap each ball individually in plastic and refrigerate until ready to use.) Dust a work surface with flour and roll each piece of dough into a rectangle (or whatever shape you like; I like irregular shapes).\nBrush the grill with oil and arrange each piece of dough on the grill; you might need to work in batches here. Grill until the dough is stiff and crisp and has lovely grill marks on it, then flip and repeat on the second side, moving occasionally so the bottom doesn't burn.\nPut the pizzas on baking sheets, smear each with some of the ricotta mixture, top with sausage and put as many pizzas as will comfortably fit in the oven; bake until the cheese has melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Again, you may have to work in batches. Remove the pizzas from the oven, top with arugula and drizzle with the deliciously spicy chili oil!",

    "original_instructions": "Finely slice the peppers and onions. Make a paste out of the garlic and 1 teaspoon of salt. Seed and slice the Scotch bonnet pepper, dice the tomatoes and set them aside. Soften the onions and peppers in the sunflower oil over high heat for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Add the pasted garlic, Scotch bonnet pepper, tomatoes, and dry seasonings and cook for another 10 minutes over medium heat, stirring frequently. Add the tomato paste, cook for another minute or so, then remove from the heat. Blend the mixture with a generous 3/4 cup of chicken stock. If this was prepared in advance, reheat it first. Add another 3/4 cup of stock and blend until the mixture is smooth. Add the palm oil, a final teaspoon of salt, and then pour 2 1/2 cups of this mixture back into the pot. Heat the sauce until it is lightly bubbling. Measure out your rice, then add to the pot. The pot should have a tight-fitting lid, but if it doesn\u2019t you can use some foil with the shiny side facing down to retain the heat. Stir gently so that all the rice is coated with the red sauce, then reduce the heat to a very low flame\u2014the lowest possible. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Open the lid and stir gently again. It is important to get under the center of the pan so all the rice cooks at the same rate. Cover and simmer for another 10 minutes. Open and stir for a final time, then simmer for a final 10 minutes. This makes 30 minutes cooking time in total. Turn the heat off and allow to steam, covered, for another 15 minutes. It\u2019s tempting to open the pot here but it\u2019s very important to trust the process and allow the rice to cook residually. This improves the final taste and texture of the rice. Open the lid then leave to stand for 5 minutes, uncovered. Then fluff with a fork to separate the rice, slowly working inward from the edge of the pan in a swirling motion. If the rice is not completely cooked, add the remaining 1/2 cup stock, stir gently, then place back over low heat for another 10 minutes.

    "original_instructions": "1. Heat oven to 375 degrees F.\n2. Wash the turkey, inside and out, and dry well. Coat inside and outside with olive oil. Season turkey on the outside with salt and pepper, pressing it in to adhere. Place 2 rosemary sprigs, 1 thyme sprig, 1 sage sprig, 1 oregano sprig and lemon halves inside the cavity of the turkey. Place cooling rack or roasting rack in bottom of large roasting pan. Place turkey on rack, and arrange carrots, celery and remaining herbs on bottom of pan around turkey. Pour 4 cups (1 carton) chicken broth and water over vegetables and herbs.\n3. Roast until an instant-read thermometer (inserted deep into the thigh but away from the bone) reads 165 degrees F and juices in the thigh run clear when pierced with a fork, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, basting with pan broth every 30 minutes. Remove turkey from the pan and let rest for 15 minutes before carving. Strain and reserve pan juices, and discard vegetables.\n4. While turkey is resting, make the gravy. In a medium heavy saucepan, cook flour and butter over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until a blond roux is formed. Add pan juices and 4 cups (1 carton) of chicken broth; heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce the heat and let simmer until thickened and ready to serve.\n5. Carve turkey as desired, and serve with gravy.\nCopyright 2010 Michael Chiarello\nRecipe provided by Chef Michael Chiarello - June 2010.",

    "original_instructions": "Combine the garlic, ginger, chiles and 3 tablespoons kosher salt in a food processor and process to a fine paste; transfer the marinade to a large bowl. Using a paring knife, pierce each chicken wing two or three times through the skin then add to the marinade, tossing to coat evenly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or preferably overnight.\nMeanwhile, toast the coconut in a medium skillet over medium heat, stirring often until golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the coconut to a bowl and let cool.\nMake the raita: Combine the cucumber and 1 teaspoon salt in colander set over a bowl, toss to combine and let stand for 30 minutes. Use your hands to squeeze as much moisture as possible from the cucumbers, then transfer them to a bowl. Stir in the yogurt, cilantro, lime zest and juice. Season the raita with more salt and pepper then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use, up to 2 days. Stir before serving.\nPut the chickpea flour in a large bowl. Using tongs, remove half the wings from the marinade and toss with the flour to coat evenly. Transfer the wings to a wire rack set over a baking sheet and repeat the dredging process with the remaining wings. Discard any leftover chickpea flour.\nHeat 2 inches of oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 350 degrees F. Working in 2 batches, fry the wings, turning occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, 16 to 18 minutes per batch. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the wings to a large bowl and sprinkle with salt. (Make sure the oil returns to the proper temperature between batches.)\nToast the mustard and coriander seeds in a medium skillet over medium heat, swirling the pan until the mustard seeds begin to pop and the spices are fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the turmeric, cook for 10 seconds, then stir in the butter. Heat until the butter melts and the spices begin to sizzle, about 1 minute. Pour the butter and spices over the chicken wings, toss to coat, then transfer to a serving platter. Add the toasted coconut to the seasonings left in the large bowl, then sprinkle over the wings.

    "original_instructions": "Special equipment: A small roasting pan and rack, butcher's twine\nPat the chicken dry inside and out with paper towels, and let sit at room temperature to take the chill off, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 450 degrees F. Put a rack in a small roasting pan.\nSeason the cavity of the chicken generously with salt and pepper, and stuff it with the thyme and garlic. Tie the legs together with butcher's twine. Season the outside with salt (generously) and a few grinds of pepper, and place the chicken breast-side up on the rack. (Seasoning the chicken when on the rack could result in gravy that's too salty.)\nRoast the chicken until the skin is golden brown and crispy and a thermometer inserted in the deepest part of the thigh registers 165 to 170 degrees F, depending on how you like your dark meat, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Let the chicken rest on the rack for a few minutes, then carefully tip it forward to drain all the collected juices into the roasting pan. Discard the thyme and garlic. Let the chicken rest on a cutting board while you make the gravy. (To transfer the chicken easily, hold a wooden spoon handle in the cavity with one hand and use the other hand to lift the chicken with tongs.)\nRemove the rack from the pan, and pour the pan drippings into a small bowl. Skim off 2 tablespoons of the fat, and stir them into the flour and 2 tablespoons water in another small bowl. Heat the roasting pan over medium-high heat, add the wine, scrape up any browned bits and simmer until the wine reduces by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the chicken stock and any remaining pan drippings, bring to a simmer, add the flour mixture and whisk constantly until the liquid thickens into a gravy, 2 to 3 minutes. Season the gravy with salt and pepper.\nRemove the butcher's twine from the chicken. Snip off the wingtips using kitchen shears; reserve to make stock. Remove the leg quarters by slicing between the thigh and the body, then finding the hip joints near the backbone and slicing through them. Separate the drumsticks and thighs, and transfer to a platter. Sit the carcass upright; snip out the backbone and reserve it to make stock. Lay the breast skin-side up and slice in half through the breastbone. Separate the wings and breast, and transfer to the platter. Serve the chicken with the warm gravy.
