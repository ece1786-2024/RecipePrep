Spread 1/2 teaspoon of the chile paste over the surface and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Trim and halve the scallions lengthwise. Lay them side-by-side across the lower third of the chicken, so there is white and greens at both ends. Top with 2 or 3 pieces of the red and yellow peppers. Roll the chicken around the vegetables into a tight cylinder. Thread a wooden skewer through the seam of the roll to seal. Repeat with the remaining chicken and vegetables to make 4 rolls. These can be made up to 24 hours ahead and refrigerated.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F.\nHeat the oil in an oven-proof nonstick skillet over high heat. Season the rolls with salt and pepper, to taste. Lay the rolls, seam side down, in the pan, and cook, turning occasionally, until browned, about 2 minutes. Transfer the pan to the oven, and cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes more. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Combine the lime juice, fish sauce, water, chile paste, honey, mint and coriander in a small bowl and set aside.\nTo serve: Carefully remove the skewers, taking care to keep the rolls intact. Cut across the rolls to make round pieces about 3/4-inch thick, and thread onto skewers. Transfer to a platter, sprinkle with peanuts and serve with the dipping sauce.",

Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and roast for 10 minutes or until soft to the touch.\nSlice the zucchini in thirds crosswise; slice each piece into quarters lengthwise. For a classic French presentation, round the angled sides to form 12 oval sticks\nSeason the chicken with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon pepper, and 1 teaspoon herbs. Heat a saute pan over medium-high heat and add the olive oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Sear the chicken breasts on 1 side for about 2 minutes and turn over. Add the leeks, carrots, mushrooms, zucchini, and garlic. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute to sear the vegetables. Add the white wine, and boil until the wine is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Stir in the stock and bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the Swiss chard to 1 side of the pan to braise the greens in the cooking liquid, about 1 minute.\nTo serve: Place 1/2 cup of the Swiss chard in the center of 4 large soup bowls. Slice each chicken breast on an angle into 5 pieces. Arrange the chicken on top of the Swiss chard. Divide the vegetables among the 4 bowls and ladle the broth around the vegetables.",

        "original_instructions": "Put the pork on a large cutting board and very finely mince it with a sharp, heavy knife or cleaver until the fat is broken down (or use 2 large heavy cleavers to get the job done quicker!). Spread out the pork into a thin layer on the board. Grate the ginger, shallot and bouillon over the meat using a fine grater, and then sprinkle on the cornstarch, five-spice, Shaoshing, salt, pepper and egg yolk. Mix well until combined using a knife or spatula.\nPut some cornstarch in a shallow bowl. Roll the pork mixture into ping pong ball-size meatballs, and then roll in the cornstarch to lightly coat. Shake off the excess and transfer the meatballs to a plate.\nUsing wet hands, put some of the soaked rice in your palm and roll the meatball in it with your hands, pressing gently, until evenly coated in rice. Continue rolling until the meatballs are all coated with the rice.\nFill a wok one-third full with water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Put a shallow flat bowl or plate with a lip into a bamboo steamer basket (make sure the plate is at least 1/2 inch smaller than the diameter of the basket) and evenly space the rice balls on the plate, being sure they do not touch each other. Cover the basket with the lid and lower it into the wok. Steam the meatballs, adding water to the wok as necessary to prevent the basket from scorching, until set and firm, 20 to 25 minutes.\nCarefully remove the rice balls from the steamer and transfer to a platter. Serve the meatballs with toothpicks on the side for skewering and dipping into vinegar, chili oil, or soy sauce.",

Combine the flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Add the water and olive oil and mix to make a shaggy, sticky dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead into a smooth and elastic ball, 2 to 3 minutes. Divide the dough in half and shape each half into a flat disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and let rest in a warm place, 15 minutes.\nBrush two large sheets of parchment paper with olive oil. Place a ball of dough between the parchment, oiled-sides in; use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a 12- to 14-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Remove the top piece of parchment and transfer the dough (and the bottom piece of parchment) to a pizza peel or inverted baking sheet.\nSpread 1/3 cup sauce on the crust; scatter with 3/4 cup mozzarella. Slide the pizza (on the parchment) onto the hot stone. Bake until the crust is crisp and golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let cool 1 to 2 minutes before slicing. Repeat to make the second pizza.\nPhotograph by Levi Brown",

Place the rosemary in the dish and allow to marinate on the counter at room temperature for 1 hour, turning the steaks halfway through to infuse all over with rosemary.\nFor the rosemary butter: In a saucepan over medium-low heat, add the butter and salt. Stir to melt the butter and dissolve the salt, then add the rosemary. Continue cooking on low until the butter is fragrant from the rosemary, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove the rosemary and discard.\nPreheat a grill or grill pan to high heat. Remove the steaks from the baking dish, discard the rosemary and place the steaks directly on the grill. Cook for about 5 minutes on both sides for medium-rare. Remove from the grill and allow to rest under loosely fitted aluminum foil for 10 minutes.\nUsing the direction of the muscles as a guide, thinly slice the meat against the grain into strips and place on a serving dish.

        "original_instructions": "For the chili oil: Bring the chilies and oil to a simmer in a small saucepan; remove from the heat and let the peppers steep in the oil for at least an hour or until the dough has risen and you're ready to make the pizzas. This can be done way in advance.\nFor the dough: In a small bowl, add 1/2 cup warm water (if the water is too hot the yeast will die and if the water is too cold the yeast will not activate). Add the dry yeast and sugar, stir to combine and let sit for 15 minutes. The top of the water will bubble and it will smell very yeasty; this is what you want.\nIn a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour and add the olive oil and the yeast/water mixture. Using a fork, gradually stir the flour into the yeast/water mix. Once most of the flour has combined, turn the dough out to a smooth, clean work surface dusted with flour and use your hands to knead the dough to a smooth consistency.\nLightly coat the mixing bowl with oil, return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap and set in a warm place until the dough has doubled in size, at least 1 hour.\nFor the pizza topping: Coat a large saute pan with oil, add the sausage and bring to medium heat. Cook the sausage until brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and reserve.\nWhile the sausage cooks, mix together in a medium bowl the ricotta, Parmigiano-Reggiano and oregano.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees F and preheat a grill.\nWhen the dough is ready, portion it into six golf-ball-size pieces. (If you're not using the dough right away, wrap each ball individually in plastic and refrigerate until ready to use.) Dust a work surface with flour and roll each piece of dough into a rectangle (or whatever shape you like; I like irregular shapes).\nBrush the grill with oil and arrange each piece of dough on the grill; you might need to work in batches here. Grill until the dough is stiff and crisp and has lovely grill marks on it, then flip and repeat on the second side, moving occasionally so the bottom doesn't burn.\nPut the pizzas on baking sheets, smear each with some of the ricotta mixture, top with sausage and put as many pizzas as will comfortably fit in the oven; bake until the cheese has melted, 3 to 4 minutes. Again, you may have to work in batches. Remove the pizzas from the oven, top with arugula and drizzle with the deliciously spicy chili oil!",
