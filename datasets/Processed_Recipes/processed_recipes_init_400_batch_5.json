Add the butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Add the vodka and 2 tablespoons ice water; pulse until the dough just comes together but is still crumbly. Turn out onto a piece of plastic wrap; shape into a disk and wrap. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight.\nMake the filling: Put the cherries in a medium bowl. Whisk 1/4 cup cherry juice with the cornstarch in a small bowl. Transfer to a small saucepan and add the remaining 1 1/4 cups cherry juice and the sugar. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook, whisking constantly, until thick and glossy, about 30 seconds. Pour over the cherries. Add the almond extract and gently fold to combine.\nPosition racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven with a baking sheet on the lower rack; preheat to 425 degrees F. Roll out the dough into a 12-inch round on a lightly floured surface. Ease the dough into a 9-inch pie plate. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp with your fingers or a fork. Refrigerate until firm, about 30 minutes.\nAdd the filling to the chilled crust. Transfer the pie to the hot baking sheet and bake 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F and continue baking until the crust is golden and the filling is bubbling, about 55 more minutes. (Tent the crust with foil if it browns too quickly.) Transfer to a rack.\nMeanwhile, make the topping: Combine the almonds, sugar and egg white in a medium bowl; stir to coat. Spread on a parchment-lined baking sheet in a single layer. Bake on the upper oven rack, stirring halfway through, until dry and lightly golden, about 10 minutes. Let cool completely, then break into clusters. Sprinkle around the edge of the warm pie.

        "original_instructions": "For the short ribs: Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil in a heavy-bottom pot or Dutch oven over high heat. When the oil begins to smoke slightly, place the short ribs in the pot and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast on all sides until well browned, about 15 minutes total. Remove from the pot and reduce the temperature to medium.\nAdd the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the same pot and add the celery, carrots and onion and cook over medium-low heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes. Add the wine and raise the heat level to high, bring to a boil and cook until the liquid is reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Tie the rosemary and thyme together with kitchen twine and add the bundle to the pot.\nPlace the roasted ribs on top of the vegetables in the pot and add the beef stock. Bring to a simmer over high heat. Cover the pot and simmer until the meat is very tender, about 2 1/2 hours.\nCarefully remove the short ribs from the pot and set aside. Discard the herbs and skim the excess fat. Continue to cook the vegetables and sauce over medium heat for 20 minutes until reduced to the desired consistency. Put the ribs back in the pot and heat through.\nFor the polenta: Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a large saucepan over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and very slowly whisk in the cornmeal polenta, whisking constantly to make sure there are no lumps. Switch to a wooden spoon and add the salt and pepper and simmer, stirring almost constantly, until the polenta thickens, about 30 minutes. When the polenta is thick and difficult to stir, quickly turn off the heat, add the grated cheeses and fold together. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pan thoroughly while combining.\nFor the mission fig glaze: Heat the olive oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepot over low heat and saute the shallots until just translucent, a few minutes. Add the vinegar and herbs and increase the heat to medium high. Reduce by half, stirring constantly. Add the figs, sugar and wine and further reduce by a third, continuing to stir throughout. Remove from the heat when you have about 3/4 cup liquid remaining. Pour the glaze through a fine mesh strainer into a small bowl, discarding the solids.\nHeat the olive oil in a large heavy pot or skillet over medium high heat.\nThoroughly wash the kale and remove the stems. Tear the leaves into large bite-size pieces and dry them, either in a salad spinner or on paper towels.\nDrop 5 to 7 pieces of kale in the hot oil and fry until crisp, 60 to 90 seconds. Drain on a wire rack set over paper towels and season with kosher salt while hot. Repeat with the remaining kale until all the pieces are crisp.\nTo serve, spoon some polenta on each serving plate. Place a hot short rib from the cooking liquid on the polenta and spoon over some of the reduced liquid. Drizzle with the fig glaze. Top with some crispy kale.",

Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Place apple, orange, and onion in cavity. Tie legs with kitchen twine. Rub bird inside and out with butter. Season skin lightly with salt and pepper. When coals are covered with ash, spread half on either side of disposable pan. Set top grate on grill. Place turkey on grate over pan (do not allow any part of turkey to sit over coals). Cover grill. Insert stem of an instant-read thermometer into hole in hood. Maintain temperature as close as possible to 350\u00b0F by opening vents to increase temperature and closing vents to reduce it, lifting grate with turkey to replenish coals as needed using charcoal chimney. If using wood chips, scatter a handful of drained chips over charcoal every 30 minutes. Cook turkey, rotating every hour for even browning (lift the grate with the turkey on it; rotate grate 180 degrees), until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of the thigh without touching bone registers 165\u00b0F (juices should run clear when thermometer is removed), about 2 3/4 hours.

Add a generous chunk of butter and a glug of oil and saut\u00e9 the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes until soft but not colored. 3. Add the rice and stir vigorously around the pan for a couple of minutes until the grains start to turn slightly translucent at the edges. Deglaze the pan by pouring in the wine and scraping up the bits at the bottom. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for a minute or two to burn off the alcohol. 4. Meanwhile, heat the stock and add the soaking liquor from the mushrooms. Add a ladleful of the hot stock mixture to the rice and stir over medium heat until absorbed, then add another ladleful. Repeat until all the stock is used up or the rice is tender but still al dente. Make sure to stir regularly to create a creamy risotto. (This should take about 20 minutes.) 5. Chop the rehydrated mushrooms into small pieces and gently stir into the cooked risotto. Add a chunk of butter and the Parmesan, then stir to mix well. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary, then leave the risotto to cool (it will do this more quickly if you spread it onto a baking sheet). 6.

Once the risotto is cooled (it doesn't matter if it is still a little warm, as long as it has stiffened up a bit and is cool enough to handle), roll it into balls the size of golf balls. Push a piece of mozzarella into the middle of each ball, making sure that the cheese is completely enclosed. Leave to set in the fridge for at least 30 minutes or overnight. 9.
