Add the egg but don't stir it in yet.\nHeat the milk and coconut oil in a saucepan until a thermometer reads 110 degrees F. (If the milk is too hot when you add it to the flour mixture, it will kill the yeast.)\nPour the milk mixture into the flour mixture. Avoid pouring it directly on the egg-you don't want the hot milk to cook it.\nUsing the dough hook, mix on medium speed until the dough comes together and starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl, 3 to 4 minutes. Scrape down the sides with a rubber spatula, if needed. The dough will look a little irregular in texture.\nKnead the dough.\nTurn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth, soft and elastic, 3 to 4 minutes. Shape into a ball and place in a large bowl lightly oiled with coconut oil; rub the top of the dough with a little more coconut oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 1 to 2 hours.\nForm the muffins.\nSprinkle 2 baking sheets with cornmeal and set aside. After the dough rises, punch it down and divide into 16 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball, then flatten into a 3-inch disk. Place the disks on the baking sheets.\nCook the muffins.\nHeat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Coat the skillet with cooking spray and liberally sprinkle with cornmeal. Working in batches, cook the muffins until they are deep golden brown, 5 to 9 minutes per side. If they start to rise in a domed fashion, flatten them with a spatula.

Add 10 tablespoons butter and 3/4 cup warm water and mix with the paddle attachment until combined. Add the granulated sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, the almond and vanilla extracts and ground cinnamon; mix until combined, about 1 more minute. Cover and refrigerate.\nMake the filling: Simmer 1/2 cup water and the cinnamon stick in a saucepan until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes. Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons brown sugar and cook, stirring to dissolve, about 1 minute. Add the pineapple, honey and cinnamon water, including the cinnamon stick; cook, stirring, until the mixture is almost dry, about 5 minutes.\nRemove the pan from the heat. Add the rum, then return to medium heat. Tilt the pan so the rum ignites (or hold a lit match near the sauce to ignite it). Cook until the pineapple is slightly caramelized, about 3 minutes. Stir in the pecans; set aside to cool.\nDrain the husks and pat dry. Tear each husk lengthwise into a 3 1/2-inch-wide piece. Tear some of the excess husks into 18 thin strips for ties; reserve the husk scraps. Lay the 3 1/2-inch-wide husks on a clean surface. Starting 1/2 inch from the wide end, spread 1 tablespoon of the dough down a husk, leaving a 1/2-inch border on the sides. Spoon 1 tablespoon of the pineapple filling down the center of the dough. Roll lengthwise into a tight cylinder. Fold up the narrow end; tie with a strip of corn husk to secure. Repeat with the remaining husks, dough and filling.\nSet a steamer basket in a large pot filled with 1 to 2 inches of water. Set a small bowl upside down in the basket, then arrange the tamales standing up in the steamer, folded-side down, leaning against the bowl. Cover with husk scraps, then lay a damp kitchen towel on top. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, cover and steam until the tamales pull away from the husks, about 40 minutes.

Place them in a bowl, and mix well with 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Make a bed of coarse salt in a roasting pan, and spread the shallots out in a single layer over the salt. Roast in the oven for about 20 minutes, basting with additional olive oil to prevent the outer layer of the shallots from toughening. The shallots are done when they're browned outside and just soft inside. Keep warm.\nRinse the sorrel and the greens. Dry well, and keep cool. Prepare the vinaigrette: Place the mustard in a bowl. Whisk in the vinegar. Add 1/2 cup of the olive oil slowly, in a thin stream. Add 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, and season with salt and pepper to taste.\nLay out the monkfish fillets. Cut 1/4-inch notches all around the perimeter of each fillet. (This prevents the fillets from curling up in the pan.) Dredge the fillets well in flour, seasoned with salt and pepper. Place the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil in a saute pan over medium-high heat. When the oil is very hot, saute the monkfish quickly, about 1 minute per side, until golden brown and just cooked. Remove from pan, and brush each fillet very lightly with a bit of the vinaigrette.\nAssemble the salad: Place the dried greens in a large bowl. Cut the warm shallots in half, lengthwise, and toss with the salad. Add the vinaigrette, and mix well.

        "original_instructions": "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F and lightly oil 2 large shallow roasting pans. Remove meat from bones where possible and cut into 1-inch pieces. If using breast bones, cut apart. In roasting pans arrange bones and meat in one layer and roast in upper and lower thirds of oven, switching pans halfway through roasting, until bones are golden brown, 30 to 45 minutes. Into a 14-quart stockpot put bones, meat, and 8 quarts water. (Alternatively, divide bones, meat, and 8 quarts water between two 7- to 8-quart kettles.) Discard fat from roasting pans. Immediately add 1/2 cup water to each pan, scraping up brown bits, and add to stockpot or kettles. Bring liquid to a tremble, about 190\u00b0F., and cook at 190\u00b0F. (skim froth frequently during first hour of cooking) 12 to 14 hours. While stock is cooking, separately cut carrots, onions, and white and pale green parts of leeks into 1-inch pieces. In a bowl of cold water wash leeks well and lift from water into a colander to drain. In an oiled large shallow roasting pan arrange carrots, onions, and leeks in one layer and roast in middle of oven until golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes. Cool vegetables and chill, covered. Add roasted vegetables and remaining ingredients to stock during last 2 hours of cooking. Pour stock in batches through a large fine sieve into an 8-quart kettle and discard solids. Skim off fat. (Alternatively, cool stock, uncovered, and chill, covered. Scrape congealed fat from chilled stock.) Gently simmer stock, skimming froth occasionally, until reduced to about 2 quarts, about 1 hour. Cool stock, uncovered, and chill, covered. Stock keeps, covered and chilled, 1 week or, frozen in airtight containers, 3 months.
