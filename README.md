### Main Code Walkthrough

Please read the DataPrcoessing_1.ipynb about how to use them. Following are some helper functions if you just want to run the process end to end.

#### To have a smaller dataset for testing
See this example test function `recipe_dataset_gen.test_get_testing_dataset`, and use the functions called inside 

#### To process the paragraph style recipes into structured labels
See main notebook `get_processed_recipe_dataset()`

#### To get nutrient mapping for the processed recipes:

See main notebook **Ingredient-Nutrient Mapping** section. The major functions are:
1. get_food_code_for_ingredients()
2. get_all_ingredient_mapping()
3. food_nutrient_mapping_helpder.save_nut_map

## Dataset Filtering

### Data source

1. **Processed recipe dataset**: `./datasets/Processed_Recipes`
2. **Ingredient-nutrient map**: `./ingre_nutrition_map`

### Filtering criteria

- **Health Score**: Quantifies the nutrient balance of each recipe, (detailed in the **Evaluation** Section). Recipes with a health score below 3 are filtered out.

### Code

1. **`RAG_health_score_ver5.ipynb`**: The notebook for calculating the health score and adding it as an attribution in the recipe JSON file.
2. **`RAG_health_score.py`**: The Python functions inplementing the health score algorithm.
3. **`recipe_filter.ipynb`**: The notebook for filtering recipes and merging balanced recipes in a JSON file.

### Main Code walkthrough

#### To calculate recipes' health score

Use the major function `get_health_score_with_rag()` in `RAG_health_score.py`.

Examples Usages in the same file:

- For a single recipes
- For multiple recipes stored in a JSON file.

For a detailed algorithm flow and output examples, refer to `RAG_health_score_ver5.ipynb`.

#### To filter recipes

Use `filter()` in the `recipe_filter.ipynb` notebook.

### Filtered dataset

- **Filtered Recipes**: `./datasets/filtered_recipes_419.json`  
  Contains 419 balanced recipes with a health score of 3 or higher.

## Evaluation

### Criteria

1. **Health Score**: Measures the nutrient balance of a recipe based on the WHO Nutrient Intake Goals. Seven macronutrients are considered:  
   - **Proteins**  
   - **Carbohydrates**  
   - **Sugars**  
   - **Sodium**  
   - **Fats**  
   - **Saturated Fats**  
   - **Fibres**  

   Each macronutrient that falls within the recommended range scores 1 point. The total score (out of 7) is the recipe’s health score.
2. **Relevance**: Evaluates how well the recipe meets user requirements, including:  
   - **Cooking Tools**  
   - **Cooking Time**  
   - **Ingredient Similarity**  
3. **Consistency**: Assesses the quality of the generated recipe based on:  
   - **Instructional Clarity**  
   - **Measurement Consistency**  
   - **Logical Step Sequencing**

### Code

1. **`RAG_health_score.py`**: The Python function for health score calculation algorithm.
2. **`recipe_relevance_ver3.py`**: The Python function for relevance evaluation algorithm.

### Main Code walkthrough

#### To calculate recipes' health score

Use the major function `get_health_score_with_rag()` in `RAG_health_score.py`.

#### To evaluate recipes' relevance

Use the major function `relevance_evaluation()` in `recipe_relevance_ver3.py`.
Refer to the example in the file for guidance on function usage.

### Evaluation Function Output

1. **`get_health_score_with_rag()`**:
Returns the health score and a summary of points for the input recipe.

    **Example Output**:

    ```json
    {
        'total_health_score': 3,
        'summary_of_points': {
            'Proteins': 0, 
            'Carbohydrates': 0, 
            'Sugars': 1, 
            'Sodium': 0, 
            'Fats': 0, 
            'Saturated Fats': 1, 
            'Fibers': 1}
    }
    ```

2. **`relevance_evaluation()`**:
Returns the relevance evaluation results for the input recipe.

    **Example Output**:

    ```json
    {
        'cooking_tools': True, 
        'cooking_time': 0, 
        'ingredient_overlap_rate': 66.66666666666666
    }
    ```

    **Explanation**:

    - `cooking_tools`:
        - `True` if the recipe meets the tool requirement; otherwise, `False`.
    - `cooking_time`:
        - `0` if the cooking time is within the user's limit.
        - Positive value indicating the exceeded time (in minutes).
    - `ingredient_overlap_rate`:
        - The overlap rate of user inputs and recipe ingredients.
        - 100% means all ingredients needed for the recipe can be found in user's inputs.
