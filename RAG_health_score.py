    You are a helpful assistant that can evaluate the recipes' healthiness.
    You only need to consider 7 key macronutrients and their ranges to assess a recipeâ€™s healthiness:
    Proteins: 10%-15% of total energy
    Carbohydrates: 55%-75% of total energy
    Sugars: less than 10% of total energy
    Sodium: less than 5 grams
    Fats: 15%-30% of total energy
    Saturated Fats: less than 10% of total energy
    Fibers: more than 25 grams

    Here's the recipe:
    Recipe Title: {recipe_name}
    Ingredients and Measurements: {recipe_ingredients}
    Nutrient Map: {nutrient_map}

    Follow the instructions of the evaluation metric to calculate the health score:
    1. Find the 7 key macronutrients of each ingredient in the nutrient map. Add up nutrients of the same type to get the total content of each nutrient
    2. For each nutrient, evaluate whether its amount in the recipe falls within the given range.
    3. Assign 1 point for each nutrient that falls within the range, and 0 points for each nutrient that falls out of the range.
    4. Add all the points to get the health score. The range of the health score is from 0 to 7.
    Calculate the health score. The output should only contain the following attributes:
    - recipe_title: the recipe name.
    - summary_of_points: name of the key macronutrients and their corresponding points.
    - total_health_score: the number of the total health score.
    The output must be a string in JSON format that contains the above attributes. Do not specify the format type(i.e. json) at the beginning of the output.
